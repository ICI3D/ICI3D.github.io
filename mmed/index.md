## Intended audience

This clinic targets quantitative scientists, including mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and infectious disease epidemiologists with strong quantitative backgrounds. Applicants should be junior researchers based at institutions in the US, Canada, or Africa. Participants will engage with meaningful questions about infectious disease dynamics by integrating mathematical models with epidemiological data.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to eight places for applicants from US-based institutions; the number of students from African institutions is yet to be determined.
