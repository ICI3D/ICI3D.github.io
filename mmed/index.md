subtitle: Clinic on Meaningful Modeling of Infectious Disease Data
---

The ICI3D Program invites applications to the fifth annual **Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data (MMED)**, which will be held at the African Institute for Mathematical Science in Muizenberg, South Africa on June 2-13, 2014.

This 2­‐week modeling clinic will emphasize the use of data in understanding infectious disease dynamics. The Clinic will bring together graduate students, postdoctoral students, and researchers from North America and Africa, with the goal of engaging participants in epidemiological modeling projects that use real data to grapple with practical questions in a meaningful way.

## Intended audience

This clinic targets quantitative scientists, including mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and selected infectious disease epidemiologists. Applicants should be junior researchers based at institutions in the US, Canada, or Africa. Participants will engage with meaningful questions about infectious disease dynamics by integrating mathematical models with epidemiological data.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to eight places for applicants from US-based institutions; the number of students from African institutions is yet to be determined. Funding is being sought to support participants based at Canadian institutions.
