The MMED 2016 program includes a number of parallel sessions for participants with different backgrounds. **Track A** is designed for those with a mathematical background, particularly those who have extensive training and/or experience with differential equation models of infectious disease dynamics. **Track B** is designed for those with a background in epidemiology and/or statistics, particularly those who are involved in data collection for infectious disease systems.

*The schedule below is **preliminary** and subject to change. Materials linked from this page are also subject to change and should not be considered final until the conclusion of the relevant session.*
