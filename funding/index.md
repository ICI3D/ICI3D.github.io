Please acknowledge the ICI3D program and relevant funding sources in
any papers or conference presentations that either (1) arose during an
ICI3D program or (2) were sufficiently influenced by attendance of an
ICI3D program such that you believe it warrants
acknowledgement. Please use the above funding summary to determine
which funding sources should be acknowledged for your work. See below for an
example funding statement for a project that arose during MMED 2014:

"This project arose during the 2014 Clinic on the Meaningful Modeling
of Epidemiological Data (MMED), which is part of the International
Clinics on Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data (ICI3D). MMED 2014 was
supported by National Institute of General Medical Sciences award
R25GM102149 and by the South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in
Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA))

Please note the following:

* The ICI3D name was created in 2012 when we added additional clinics,
though earlier Clinics are still considered as part of the same continuous program
development.
* After our first year, we changed the name of our flagship Clinic from
*Meaningful Modeling of Biological Data* (2009) to *Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data* (2010 and later).
