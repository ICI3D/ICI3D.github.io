<p>The <strong>International Disease Dynamics and Data (I3D) Research Scholars Exchange Program</strong> provides an opportunity for former participants in the MMED and DAIDD clinics to engage more deeply with infectious disease research problems in collaboration with the ICI3D faculty. The I3D program funds scholars to spend 6 weeks working on an approved research project at the faculty supervisorâ€™s home institution. I3D scholars from Africa work with faculty at a North American institution, and American I3D scholars work with faculty at African institutions.</p>

<p>To be considered for the I3D Research Scholars Exchange Program, participants must be nominated by the ICI3D faculty. Nominated participants are expected to develop a project proposal in collaboration with an ICI3D faculty supervisor of their choosing and can submit their application for consideration by meeting any of the upcoming deadlines. Application instructions are included in the letter of nomination sent to nominated participants.</p>
