### R and R studio

- First, you should get comfortable using R at AIMS. We encourage you to use R through the [R Studio](http://rstudio.org) interface, because it allows you to run scripts line by line or region by region which will help you move through the tutorials. R Studio is already installed on the AIMS computers and should be accessible through the Applications tab.

### Introduction to R

**Note that the Benchmark Questions you are asked to complete for Tutorials 2 and 3 are different from those for the MMED clinic.**

- Introduction to R, Tutorial 1: [Introduction to R and its quirks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/ICI3D_RTutorial_1.R)
- Introduction to R, Tutorial 2: [More on Vectors, Data Frames, and Functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/ICI3D_RTutorial_2.R)
    - [ **Benchmark questions**]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/assignments/tutorials/Tutorial2_questions.pdf?raw=true): Answer these questions **instead of** the questions that are included in the Tutorial.
	- Question 4 Tip: **answer should look like the following**
	  ei.star <- function(population.size, R0) {
	  
	  ouptut <- ????
	  
	  return(output)
	  
	  }
    - **Assignment** (*due by Wednesday evening, 27 May*): Submit your solutions to Benchmark Questions 3 and 4 to Zinhle by email.
    - Supplementary file: **[seir\_2012.R]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/assignments/tutorials/seir_2012.R?raw=true)**
- [Binomial distribution tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/binomialDistribution.R) 
- Introduction to R, Tutorial 3: [Probability Distributions and Control Structures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICI3D/RTutorials/master/ICI3D_RTutorial_3.R)
    - **Assignment** (*due by Sunday evening, 31 May*): **In addition to** completing the benchmark questions at the end of the Tutorial, download the supplementary assignment file linked below. Work through the example of a chain binomial SIR model, then complete and submit the assignment as described in the file.
