You can visit these pages to find general information on many diseases and specific information about recent outbreaks:

- [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/DiseasesConditions)
- [ProMED mail](http://www.promedmail.org) - a list serve about disease outbreaks
- [WHO disease outbreak site](http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/index.html)
- [Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD program)](http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ngDeGF8AAAAJ) - publications on the dynamics of infectious diseases, with a emphasis on data-driven modeling methods
- [Project Tycho](http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/) - long-term data sets on many infectious diseases in the US

All data to be used in the projects are made available courtesy of **Professor David Earn, Department of Mathematics, McMaster University**. The data files are available online from the International Infectious Disease Data Archive (IIDDA, <http://iidda.mcmaster.ca>). **Note that use of these data is only permitted for the purposes of this course, and any outside use must receive prior approval from Prof. Earn.** These data were originally analyzed in the following two publications:

- [D. J. D. Earn; P. Rohani; B. M. Bolker; B. T. Grenfell (2000) A simple model for complex dynamical transitions in epidemics Science 287(5453): 667-670.]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/references/Earn2000.pdf?raw=true)
- [C. T. Bauch and D. J. D. Earn (2003) Transients and Attractors in Epidemics. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B 270:1573-1578.]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/references/Bauch2003.pdf?raw=true)

### For groups working on London data

- All available data from London ([download]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/projectData/dataLondon_all.Rdata?raw=true))

### For groups working on US data

This paper gives a nice explanation of the relationship between infectious disease population parameters and the periodicity of the expected limit cycle:

Dynamical resonance can account for seasonality of influenza epidemics. _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America_, 101(48), 16915–6. <doi:10.1073/pnas.0407293101>]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/references/Dushoff2004.pdf?raw=true)
