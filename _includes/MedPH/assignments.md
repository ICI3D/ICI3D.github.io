### Oral presentations (project proposals)

At the end of the second week (24 June), you will have to give a short "Research Pitch" to a small group of recent MedPH students and instructors. We will help you develop your presentation throughout Weeks 1-2 of MedPH.

- Prepare a short oral presentation summarizing your research (10 minutes max, using the slide template that will be provided)
    - You should focus on a project idea that's of interest to you and would be feasible to conduct with available resources (e.g. existing data sets).
    - The presentation should include enough background information to motivate the proposed research and should clearly state the research question. You should also briefly summarize the proposed approach to the research question.
    - We recommend selecting a few visual aids (eg, figures or diagrams) that will help you explain key aspects of the proposed research. Please keep the text on your slides to a minimum.
    - You will be kept to time.

### Final written project

- [Project instructions]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/Project_guidelines.pdf)
- Your final project should be based on your project proposal but can be modified based on feedback you receive from the faculty and others. You will have three weeks to develop and write up your project (due 15 July), and we encourage you to seek feedback as you're working on it. The instructors will be available for online meetings during the week of 27 June and will be in Muizenberg and available for in-person meetings the week of 4 July.

### Other assignments

- Your marks for the course will also depend on your participation during the first two weeks of the course and your submitted responses to the benchmark questions for the required R tutorials. See the schedule tab for details of the additional assignments and when they are due.
