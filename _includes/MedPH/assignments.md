### Major Assignments

There will be two major assignments for this course, a short oral presentation (given during the MMED Clinic) and a final written project (due July 12).

### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

All sources for information, figures, and wording must be properly cited. Before submitting any assignments for this class, please **review the following**:

#### Data Sets

- Poster projects will be completed in groups, TBD:
    1. **Liberia 2014-2016 Ebola Epidemic<sup>1</sup>: Abigail and Dylan** ([download figures]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/projectData/LiberiaEVD.pdf?raw=true), [download data]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/projectData/WAevddat.Rdata?raw=true))
    2. **Sierra Leone 2014-2016 Ebola Epidemic<sup>1</sup>: Priyanka and Mandilakhe** ([download figures]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/projectData/SLEVD.pdf?raw=true), [download data]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/projectData/WAevddat.Rdata?raw=true))
    3. **Guinea 2014-2016 Ebola Epidemic<sup>1</sup>: Richard, Stephan, and Nicola** ([download figures]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/projectData/GuineaEVD.pdf?raw=true), [download data]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/projectData/WAevddat.Rdata?raw=true))

<sup>1</sup> Data from the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/rowca-ebola-cases) and cleaned by Steve Bellan.

#### Instructions

- **Step I:** Download the figures summarizing the data that your group will be working with. Each group member should pick one figure to focus on for this step. For the chosen figure, describe (in writing) what you see in the data. Do you notice any patterns? Over what timescale do these patterns occur. Then compare notes with your group members - do the data in their figure show similar or different patterns? As a group, think about what may be causing the patterns you see and the similarities and differences between data sets.
- **Step II:** As a group, learn about the natural history of the pathogens for which your group has data, documenting where you find each piece of information. Does this give you a better idea for where the pattern/s come from? Also learn about prevention and control options, and the history of their implementation, again documenting where you find each piece of information - does this give you a better idea for where the pattern/s come from? Does this help your understand the different patterns observed for different pathogens in your time period/location?
    - NOTE: You may find the references tab useful for this step. You may also want to search the scientific literature or access additional references cited on the pages below. If you are looking for a paper but don't have access, let Becky or Zinhle know and they may be able to access it for you. If so, they'll post it in the [readings folder of the course repository]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/readings).
- **Step III:** As a group, develop a research question based on a pattern observed in one or more of the time series datasets.
- **Step IV:** Figure out how to use a mechanistic infectious disease transmission model (ie, an SIR or SEIR type model) to address your research question. Remember that the type of model you use will depend on your research question, and you should try to use the simplest model possible that allows you to address your question. For example, if you are interested in what drives the period of observed cycles (and changes in the period over time), you will likely need to use a model that includes seasonal dynamics); however, if you're interested in comparing the relative incidence of different diseases in the same population at the same point of time, you may be able to use a non-seasonal model.
- **Step V:** Develop and implement a research plan to address your research question through a combination of data analysis and model development.
- **Step VI:** Use the [poster template]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/assignments/PosterTemplate.pptx) to design a poster on your project. Be sure to include background information, your research question, a description of your approach, your results, your conclusions, and next steps/further questions.

### Final written project

- [Project instructions]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/Project_guidelines.pdf)
- Your final project can be based on your project proposal or your MMED group project. You will have lot of free time during the last week of MMED to write this.
- A list of suggested topics for MMED group projects will be made available at [on this page]({{ site.url }}/projects).
