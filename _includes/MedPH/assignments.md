### Oral presentations (project proposals)

During the first week of MMED, you will have to give a short "Research Pitch" in one of the evening sessions. We will help you develop your presentation throughout Week 1 of MedPH.

- Prepare a short oral presentation summarizing your research (2 minutes max, 1 slide in PDF format)
    - You should focus on a project idea that's of interest to you and would be feasible to conduct with available resources (e.g. existing data sets).
    - The presentation should include enough background information to motivate the proposed research and should clearly state the research question. You should also briefly summarize the proposed approach to the research question.
    - We recommend selecting 1-2 visual aids (eg, figures or diagrams) that will help you explain key aspects of the proposed research. Please keep the text on your slide to a minimum.
    - You will be kept to time.

### Final written project

- [Project instructions]({{page.repo}}/blob/master/Project_guidelines.pdf)
- Your final project can be based on your project proposal or your MMED group project. You will have lot of free time during the last week of MMED to write this.
- A list of suggested topics for MMED group projects will be made available at [on this page]({{ site.url }}/projects).
