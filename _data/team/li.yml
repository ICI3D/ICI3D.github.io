bio: Michael is a scientist in the Public Health Risk Science division at the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). He is a theoretical/computational infectious disease modeler.  He focuses on human-related diseases (COVID-19, influenza, and HIV) and some wildlife diseases (canine rabies), especially in forecasting epidemic outbreaks, retrospective analysis of the evolution of infectious diseases, and intervention strategies/policies for disease control. In addition, Michael has a broad research interest in theoretical and applied statistics, mathematical biology, ecology & evolution, public health, and computations.
