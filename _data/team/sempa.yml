bio: Joseph is currently a postdoctoral fellow at SACEMA, working on the repurposing of HIV diagnostic assays for HIV management and is supervised by Prof Alex Welte. Previously, he was funded by SACEMA to do a PhD in Epidemiology, focusing on the effects of longitudinal HIV viral load on treatment outcomes in people on ART in sub-Saharan Africa, under the supervision of Prof Martin Nieuwoudt. He attended MMED in 2013 after which he received an I3D scholarship under the supervision of Prof Steve Bellan. Joseph is interested in the analysis and interpretation of dynamic range of HIV diagnostic assays, for post-diagnosis patient management.
