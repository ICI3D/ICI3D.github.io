bio: Becky received her PhD in Mathematics from the University of Florida (UF) in 2017 and is now a postdoctoral researcher in the Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia. She was an MMED participant in 2014, served as the ICI3D Program Assistant for the 2015-2016 academic year, and joined the Workshop Faculty in 2015. She uses stochastic processes to model pathogen invasion in novel host populations and is particularly interested in seasonal infectious disease dynamics.  In one project, she used a spatial model to investigate how changes in resource landscape might influence encounter rates and pathogen transmission among consumers.  Much of her current and previous work has focused on rabies transmission in wildlife populations. She has also used epidemiological case data to study potential immune-mediated interactions between dengue virus and Zika virus. Her upcoming postdoctoral research will investigate how information on antigenic change in influenza viruses may be used to improve influenza forecasts.
