summary: Rebecca received her PhD in Mathematics from the University of Florida (UF) in 2017 and is now an infectious disease researcher and modeler working for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the Influenza Division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She coordinates modeling efforts and forecasting collaborations, such as FluSight influenza forecasting. She also has interests in using multiple model projections to inform intervention and mitigation strategies. She completed a postdoc in the UF Department of Biology in 2017-2019, a postdoc in the University of Georgia Odum School of ecology in 2019-2020, and a postdoc at the Pennsylvania State University in the Huck Institute of Life Sciences in 2020-2022. She was an MMED participant in 2014, served as the ICI3D Program Assistant for the 2015-2016 academic year, and joined the Workshop Faculty in 2015.

bio: Rebecca received her PhD in Mathematics from the University of Florida (UF) in 2017 and is now an infectious disease researcher and modeler working for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the Influenza Division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She coordinates modeling efforts and forecasting collaborations, such as FluSight influenza forecasting. She also has interests in using multiple model projections to inform intervention and mitigation strategies. She earned a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Florida in May 2017, focusing on stochastic processes of invasion and extinction, with particular applications for seasonal rabies virus dynamics. She previously held postdoctoral positions at the Emerging Pathogens Institute and Department of Biology at the University of Florida, the Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, and the Huck Institute of Life Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University. Her research interests center around infectious disease modeling and public health applications. She is interested in the dynamics of co-circulating pathogens and her previous work includes investigating the effects of the 2015/2016 Zika epidemic in Latin America on endemic dengue dynamics and the emergence of novel influenza B viruses in the United States. While at the Pennsylvania State University, she helped lead multi-model efforts to inform decision support in the face of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. She worked on both the Multiple Models for Outbreak Decision Support (<a href = "https://midasnetwork.us/mmods/">MMODS</a>) and the <a href = "https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub</a> projects.
