summary: Giulio De Leo is a disease ecologist interested in investigating factors and processes driving the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems and using this knowledge to identify levers for health and conservation, i.e., ecological interventions that can improve human wellbeing and the health of the environment that underpins it.  In the last ten years, he has been particularly interested in investigating how the development of water management infrastructures to support agricultural expansion and intensification may increase the risk of transmission of schistosomiasis, one of the most important of the so called Neglected Tropical Diseases.  He co-founded "The Upstream Alliance - partners in schistosomiasis reduction" and the [Stanford Program for Disease Ecology](https://ecohealthsolutions.stanford.edu/), Health and the Environment, with the goal of developing ecological solutions to control infectious diseases with an important environmental component in their transmission cycle.
