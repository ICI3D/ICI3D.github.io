bio: Eduard is a Researcher at SACEMA who works primarily on HIV incidence estimation. He was the principal analyst for the CEPHIA collaboration, an international consortium established to independently evaluate HIV incidence assays (i.e. laboratory tests for ‘recent’ HIV infection, used in cross-sectional incidence estimation) and serves on the World Health Organisation’s technical working group on HIV incidence assays. He is also the maintainer of the open source inctools package for the R statistical programming language, which provides implementations of standard methods for cross- sectional incidence estimation and for ‘calibrating’ tests for recent infection. He has a background in social science, having obtained his PhD in economics from the University of Cape Town for work on HIV/AIDS policy and civil society health activism in Sub-Saharan Africa.
