bio: Juliet is Director of the South African DSI-NRF Centre of Excellence in Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) and Professor of Applied Mathematics at Stellenbosch University (SU). She served as the inaugural ICI3D Program Director from 2012-2016 and is a member of the ICI3D Executive Team. Before moving to SACEMA in 2016, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Emerging Pathogens Institute (EPI) at the University of Florida (2011-2016) and a Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) Program Fellow in the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies at the Fogarty International Center, NIH (2008-2011). Juliet’s research focuses on quantitative approaches to infectious disease dynamics, with a particular focus on emerging, vector-borne, and zoonotic viruses, including Ebola, Nipah, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
