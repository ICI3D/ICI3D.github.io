bio: Juliet is an Extraordinary Professor of Applied Mathematics at Stellenbosch University (SU) and former Director of the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (<a href="http://www.sacema.org/">SACEMA</a>). She is a member of the founding faculty and served as the inaugural ICI3D Program Director from 2012-2016, as well as Program Director for Africa from 2017-2022, and on the ICI3D Executive Team from 2022-2024. Before moving to SACEMA in 2016, she was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Emerging Pathogens Institute (EPI) at the University of Florida (2011-2016) and a Research and Policy for Infectious Disease Dynamics (RAPIDD) Program Fellow in the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies at the Fogarty International Center, NIH (2008-2011). Juliet’s research focuses on quantitative approaches to infectious disease dynamics, with a particular focus on emerging, vector-borne, and zoonotic viruses, including Ebola, Nipah, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.  She currently works for the US CDC but is contributing to the DAIDD workshop in her personal capacity as an approved outside activity.
