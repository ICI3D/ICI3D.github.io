# Schedule

SHADOW -- SHADOW to omit line; NOTE to omit rest of line

SHADOW -- HIDE works like NOTE; should be used for things we want to open up at or right after the session

SHADOW -- OPEN does nothing (change back to HIDE for future); I like this convention even though it's pointless to use it for a one-time meeting.

SHADOW pedagogy, funding, structure / governance, mission / strategy
