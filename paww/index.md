## Paper-writing workshops

_Paper-writing workshops are made possible by the [Center for Inference and Dynamics of Infectious Diseases](http://www.cidid.org/), a Center of Excellence of the NIGMS/NIH-MIDAS program._  

- Requests for support are accepted on a rolling basis.  
- Proposals for workshops that will bring international visitors to the US should be submitted at least 3 months before the proposed workshop dates.  
- Other proposals should be submitted at least 6 weeks before the proposed workshop dates to allow sufficient time for review of proposals and for logistical arrangements to be made.
- All paper-writing workshops for MMED 2015 project groups should be completed no later than May 31, 2016.

> **Note to applicants:** The [I3D P&P timeline](./timeline) outlines what is expected of groups receiving paper-writing support before, during, and after the paper-writing workshop.  Submission of an application for support will be considered an indication of your commitment to meet these expectations if your application is accepted.

## Presentation support

Limited funds are available to support scientific conference presentations by ICI3D program participants on work developed at the [MMED clinic](../mmed), [DAIDD clinic](../daidd), or through an [I3D exchange](../i3d). Requests should be sent, with a copy of the abstract and acceptance letter, to <pandp@ici3d.org>.

## Publication support

Publications of work developed at the [MMED clinic](../mmed), [DAIDD clinic](../daidd), or through an [I3D exchange](../i3d) may request support for payment of open access publication fees. Requests should be sent, with a copy of the accepted manuscript, to <pandp@ici3d.org>.
