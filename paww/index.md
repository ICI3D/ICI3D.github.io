## Paper-writing workshops

_Paper-writing workshops are made possible by the [Center for Inference and Dynamics of Infectious Diseases](http://www.cidid.org/), a Center of Excellence of the NIGMS/NIH-MIDAS program._  

- Requests for support are accepted on a rolling basis.  
- Proposals for workshops that will bring international visitors to the US should be submitted at least 3 months before the proposed workshop dates.  
- Other proposals should be submitted at least 6 weeks before the proposed workshop dates to allow sufficient time for review of proposals and for logistical arrangements to be made.
- All paper-writing workshops for MMED 2015 project groups should be completed no later than May 31, 2016.

> **Note to applicants:** The [I3D PaWW timeline](./timeline) outlines what is expected of groups receiving paper-writing support before, during, and after the paper-writing workshop.  Submission of an application for support will be considered an indication of your commitment to meet these expectations if your application is accepted. Groups receiving PaWW support are also encouraged to apply for [I3D P&P](../p_and_p) publication support.

### Reminder

All publications resulting from work developed at the [MMED clinic](../mmed), [DAIDD clinic](../daidd), or through an [I3D exchange](../i3d) must comply with the open access policy for NIH-funded research and are expected to acknowledge the ICI3D program and support for the program provided by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award number R25GM102149. **In addition, publications from groups receiving PaWW support must acknowledge the [Center for Inference and Dynamics of Infectious Diseases](http://www.cidid.org/) and funding provided through MIDAS-National Institute of General Medical Sciences under award U54GM111274.**
