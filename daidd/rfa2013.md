The International Clinics on Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data (ICI3D) Program invites applications to the second annual Clinic on Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data. This 1-week modeling clinic will provide an introduction to dynamical models used in the study of infectious disease dynamics. The Clinic will bring together graduate students, postdoctoral students, and researchers from North America and Africa, and instruction will focus on how the complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for addressing problems in infectious disease research.

The Clinic will consist of a series of interactive lectures and tutorials that will guide participants through the uses of dynamical modeling in epidemiology. Various modeling paradigms will be discussed, and participants will be given guidance regarding the appropriate use of models to address their own research questions. Participants are encouraged to bring data sets and questions to the Clinic, and to start collaborative projects with each other or the organizers. Working closely with their peers and with Clinic faculty, each participant will develop a research plan that describes a roadmap for integration of dynamic modeling with data collection and/or analysis in a study system of their choosing. The research plan can be used as a framework for grant or dissertation proposals when participants return to their home institutions.

**Students and researchers with a demonstrated interest in infectious disease research are encouraged to apply. Applicants with a good grounding in statistics and experience with data collection will be preferred. This workshop is not intended for those with substantial prior experience in dynamical modeling.**

Funding is available to cover room, board and travel costs for a limited number of Clinic participants from the US and Africa. The application process for the Clinic is expected to be highly competitive.

**The deadline for receipt of applications is September 16, 2013.  Late or incomplete applications will not be considered. Application instructions are available on the [Application Form](http://epi.ufl.edu/ici3d/daidd-application-form/ "DAIDD Application Form") on the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute's website.**
