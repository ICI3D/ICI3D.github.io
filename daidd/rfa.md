The International Clinics on Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data (ICI3D) Program invites applications to the annual Clinic on Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data (DAIDD). This 1-week intensive modeling clinic will provide an introduction to dynamical models used in the study of infectious disease dynamics. The Clinic will bring together graduate students, postdoctoral students, and researchers from around the world, and instruction will focus on how the complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for addressing problems in infectious disease research.

The Clinic will consist of a series of interactive lectures and tutorials that will guide participants through the uses of dynamical modeling in epidemiology. Various modeling paradigms will be discussed, with a particular focus on the development of compartmental models, and participants will be given guidance regarding the appropriate use of models to address their own research questions. Working closely with their peers and with Clinic faculty, each participant will develop a research plan that describes a roadmap for integration of dynamic modeling with data collection and/or analysis in a study system of their choosing. The research plan can be used as a framework for grant or dissertation proposals when participants return to their home institutions.

**Students and researchers with a demonstrated interest in infectious disease research are encouraged to apply. Applicants with a good grounding in statistics and experience with data collection will be preferred. This workshop is not intended for those with substantial prior experience in dynamical modeling.**

The course registration fee is ZAR 30,000. The registration fee includes room and board for the duration of the Clinic, as well as course materials. A small number of full and partial scholarships may be available for Clinic participants from the US and Africa. Participants are responsible for covering their own travel expenses (including visa fees, where applicable).

The application process for the Clinic is competitive. **The deadline for receipt of applications is 15 September 2019.** Additional applications may be considered after the deadline, on a space-available basis. Applicants who will need a visa to visit South Africa or wish to be considered for scholarship support are strongly encouraged to apply by 15 September. Incomplete applications will not be considered.
