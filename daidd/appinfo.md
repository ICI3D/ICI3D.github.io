The International Clinics on Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data
(ICI3D) Program invites applications to the eleventh annual Clinic on
Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data (DAIDD). This 1-week
intensive modeling clinic will provide an introduction to dynamical
models used in the study of infectious disease dynamics. The Clinic will
bring together postgraduate students and researchers from around the
world, and instruction will focus on how the complex dynamics of
pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for
addressing problems in infectious disease research.

The Clinic will consist of a series of interactive lectures and
tutorials that will guide participants through the uses of dynamical
modeling in epidemiology. Various modeling paradigms will be discussed,
with a particular focus on the development of compartmental models, and
participants will be given guidance regarding the appropriate use of
models to address their own research questions. Working closely with
their peers and with Clinic faculty, each participant will develop a
research plan that describes a roadmap for integration of dynamic
modeling with data collection and/or analysis in a study system of their
choosing. The research plan can be used as a framework for grant or
dissertation proposals when participants return to their home
institutions.

Students and researchers with a demonstrated interest in infectious
disease research are encouraged to apply. Applicants with a good
grounding in statistics and experience with data collection will be
preferred. This workshop is not intended for those with substantial
prior experience in dynamical modeling.

The course registration fee is ZAR 4000. A small number of
scholarships are available. Although the Clinic is virtual, applicants
are expected to give a full-time commitment for the week (\~8 hours per
day, plus four hours per day on the opening Sunday and closing
Saturday). All participants *must* have access to high-speed internet
for the duration of the Clinic.

The application process for the Clinic is competitive. **The deadline
for receipt of applications is 20 October 2023 at 23:59 SAST.**
Incomplete applications will not be considered.

**Detailed application instructions are available via [the application form](https://forms.gle/WkpwG3MjrTC7YpQo7).**
