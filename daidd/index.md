## Objectives

The Clinic on Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data (DAIDD) aims to provide participants with:

-	An understanding of dynamic principles and their role in the epidemiology of infectious diseases
-	A familiarity with diverse modeling frameworks
-	Guided experience with construction of simple models
-	A conceptual framework for fitting models to data
-	Experience creating a model world to address a research question
-	A set of identified resources for continued learning

## Intended audience

This Clinic targets public health researchers and population biologists interested in studying infectious diseases.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to twenty-four places available and encourage applications from researchers based anywhere in the world.

## Course fees

The course registration fee is ZAR 3,000 or US$215. A small number of scholarships will be available. Instructions for paying the course fee will be made available to successful applicants by early December.

## Venue

DAIDD 2021 will be held online via Microsoft Teams. All participants must have access to high-speed internet for the duration of the Clinic.
