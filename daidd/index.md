## Intended audience

This clinic targets public health researchers and population biologists interested in studying infectious diseases.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to fifteen places for applicants from US-based institutions and up to four places for applicants based at African institutions.

## Schedule

The general daily structure will be as follows:

- 8:30, 8:45 Shuttle from hotel to EPI
- 9:00-10:45 Lecture/discussion followed by a practicum
- 11:15-12:15 Writing exercise
- 1:15-3:00 Lecture/discussion followed by a practicum
- 3:15-5:00 Lecture/discussion followed by a practicum
- 5:00-6:00 Interactive sessions and exercises

We will start earlier on Monday, with shuttles at 8:00 and 8:15 and welcome/introductions from 8:30-9:00. There will be a mid-session evaluation on Wednesday evening. The Clinic will officially end by 5pm on Friday, though there will be an optional field trip on Saturday morning.
