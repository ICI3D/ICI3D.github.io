## Objectives

The Clinic on Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data (DAIDD) aims to provide participants with:

-	An understanding of dynamic principles and their role in the epidemiology of infectious diseases
-	A familiarity with diverse modeling frameworks
-	Guided experience with construction of simple models
-	A conceptual framework for fitting models to data
-	Experience creating a model world to address a research question
-	A set of identified resources for continued learning

## Intended audience

This clinic targets public health researchers and population biologists interested in studying infectious diseases.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to twenty-four places available and encourage applications from researchers based anywhere in the world.

## Course fees

The course registration fee is ZAR 30,000. The registration fee includes room and board for the duration of the Clinic, as well as course materials. A small number of full and partial scholarships may be available for Clinic participants from the US and Africa. Participants are responsible for covering their own travel expenses (including visa fees, where applicable). Instructions for paying the course fee will be made available to successful applicants by early November.

## Venue

DAIDD will be held at [Mont Fleur Conference Centre](http://montfleur.co.za/) in Stellenbosch, South Africa, which provides an ideal setting for this intensive workshop. Participants should arrive at the venue between 14:00 and 15:00 on Sunday. Information regarding arrangements for local transportation, including airport transfers, will be provided prior to the workshop.

## Schedule

Specific session times will vary by day, but the general daily structure will be as follows:

- 8:40-9:00 Faculty research talk
- 9:00-10:30 Lecture/discussion and/or tutorial
- 10:30-11:00 Morning break
- 11:00-12:30 Lecture/discussion and/or tutorial
- 12:30-2:00 Lunch break
- 2:00-3:30 Lecture/discussion and/or tutorial

- 4:00-6:00 Exercise and/or working session
- 6:00-8:00 Dinner break (dinner is served at 7)
- 8:00-9:00 Working session, feedback session, or social activity

The Clinic will begin at 16:00 on Sunday afternoon. There will be a mid-session evaluation on Wednesday evening. The Clinic will officially end by 14:00 on Saturday. **The full schedule for DAIDD {{page.year}} will be available via the Clinic website approximately 1 month before the Clinic.**
