## Intended audience

This clinic targets public health researchers and population biologists interested in studying infectious diseases.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to fifteen places for applicants from US-based institutions and up to four places for applicants based at African institutions.
