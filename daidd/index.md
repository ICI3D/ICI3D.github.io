## Intended audience

This clinic targets public health researchers and population biologists interested in studying infectious diseases.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to twenty-four places available and encourage applications from researchers based anywhere in the world.

## Course fees

The course registration fee is US$2,250 or €2,000. A discounted fee of ZAR$30,000 is available to participants from low and middle income countries. The registration fee includes room and board for the duration of the Clinic, as well as course materials. A small number of full and partial scholarships may be available for Clinic participants from the US and Africa. Participants are responsible for covering their own travel expenses (and visa fees, where applicable). Instructions for paying the course fee will be made available to successful applicants in early November.
