The ICI3D Program invites applications to the second annual **Clinic on Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data (DAIDD)**, which will be held at the University of Florida’s Emerging Pathogens Institute in Gainesville, FL in December 2014.

This 1­‐week modeling clinic will provide an introduction to dynamical models used in the study of infectious disease dynamics. The Clinic will bring together graduate students, postdoctoral students, and researchers from North America and Africa, and instruction will focus on how the complex dynamics of pathogen transmission influence study design and data collection for addressing problems in infectious disease research.

## Intended audience

This clinic targets public health researchers and population biologists interested in studying infectious diseases.

## Selection criteria

Selection of participants will be on the basis of the applicant’s academic background, the unique perspectives that they will bring to the Clinic, and the degree to which the selection committee expects the applicant will benefit from attending the Clinic. We expect to have up to fifteen places for applicants from US-based institutions and up to four places for applicants based at African institutions.
